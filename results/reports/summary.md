## Introduction 

1-20

Most of the masks fit the lesions perfectly. However, for the image "104-1755-320," the mask is entirely black (the lesion was not identified). The corresponding mask for "138-205-296" does not identify the main lesion, instead emphasizing eight distinct areas.

21-40:
Most of the masks appeared to fit their corresponding images; however, there were a few cases where the masks were inaccurate and did not properly correspond to the lesion due to pen marks or hair occlusion.

41-60:
The masks fit the lesions quite well for majority of the images, however some had imperfections. For example, lesion 717 mask did not show the affected area at the top edge of the image. Only the most noticeable lesion in Lesion 3924 was identified by the corresponding mask while other similar areas were ignored. 

81–100: 
While most masks fit the lesions well, this section is heavily impacted by clinical artifacts like purple pen marks and thick hair. These "shortcuts" could cause the model to incorrectly associate ink or hair with malignancy rather than the lesion itself.

Insights from metadata:
The dataset primarily represents an elderly population, with most patients aged 60 to 80 years old and an average male majority(57.5%). Most people do not smoke or drink, while around 31% data(about smoking and drinking) is missing. The most common diagnoses are BCC and ACK, both of which are linked to long-term sun exposure in elderly people. Overall, this data indicates a high-risk aged population, which corresponds to the large number of BCC and ACK cases seen in the dataset.
